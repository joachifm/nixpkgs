* Goals

** Ensure integrity of the kernel

** Ensure integrity of the OS runtime

- Logs
- Time
- Static OS components

** Protect hosted and user data

- /home
- /srv
- /var/lib/<service>

Must be protected even from rogue root process.

** Store privacy

- No process should be allowed to enumerate the Store
- Ideally, processes should only be permitted access to store paths they
  already know about
- Users must be able to read any store path referenced under
  /run/current-system/sw
- Users must be able to read any store path referenced by their
  own user profile
