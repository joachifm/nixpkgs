* Goals

** Ensure integrity of the kernel

** Ensure integrity of the OS runtime

- Logs
- Time
- Static OS components

** Protect hosted and user data

- /home
- /srv
- /var/lib/<service>

Must be protected even from rogue root process.

** Store privacy

- No process should be allowed to enumerate the Store
- Ideally, processes should only be permitted access to store paths they
  already know about
- Users must be able to read any store path referenced under
  /run/current-system/sw
- Users must be able to read any store path referenced by their
  own user profile

* Policy notes

/dev/kmsg
  kernel ring buffer
  may contain sensitive information
  must be tamper proof

/dev/mem
  raw access to memory

/dev/port
  raw access to I/O ports

/proc/modules
  currently loaded modules (leaks kernel pointers)

/proc/kallsyms

/proc/bus
  bus specific information

/proc/iomem
  memory map

/proc/kcore
  image of physical memory
