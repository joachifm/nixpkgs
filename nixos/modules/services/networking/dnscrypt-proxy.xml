  <title>DNSCrypt client proxy</title>

  <para>
    The DNSCrypt client proxy relays DNS queries to a DNSCrypt enabled
    upstream resolver. The traffic between the client and the upstream
    resolver is encrypted and authenticated, mitigating the risk of MITM
    attacks, DNS poisoning attacks, and third-party snooping (assuming the
    upstream is trustworthy).
  </para>

  <sect1><title>Basic configuration</title>

  <para>
    To enable the client proxy, set
    <programlisting>
      services.dnscrypt-proxy.enable = true;
    </programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
    The default configuration assumes that the DNSCrypt client
    proxy is intended to act as a transparent proxy for the system
    stub resolver.  The proxy is automatically configured to do
    its own caching in this configuration.
  </para>

  <para>
    Enabling the client proxy does not alter the system
    nameserver; to actually relay local queries, prepend
    <literal>127.0.0.1</literal> to
    <option>networking.nameservers</option>.
  </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>As a forwarder for another DNS client</title>
  <para>
    To run DNSCrypt proxy as a forwarder for another DNS
    client, change the default proxy listening port to a
    non-standard value and point the other client to it:
    <programlisting>
      services.dnscrypt-proxy.localPort = 43;
    </programlisting>
    In this configuration, the proxy will not do any caching
    on its own.
  </para>

  <para>
    <programlisting>
      {
        services.dnsmasq.enable = true;
        services.dnsmasq.servers = [ "127.0.0.1#43" ];
      }
    </programlisting>
  </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2><title>unbound</title>
  <para>
    <programlisting>
      {
        services.unbound.enable = true;
        services.unbound.forwardAddresses = [ "127.0.0.1@43" ];
      }
    </programlisting>
